# LibMan
Our Library Management System, developed using C and file structures, is a robust and efficient solution for seamlessly organizing and managing library resources. This project leverages the power of C's file handling capabilities to maintain a comprehensive database of books, patrons, and transactions. It allows librarians to efficiently track and manage book inventory, borrower records, due dates, and late fees.

With an intuitive user interface, staff can easily add, update, or delete records, while patrons can search for available books and check their account status. Utilizing file structures ensures data consistency and reliability, making it an invaluable tool for libraries of all sizes to streamline their operations and enhance user experiences.
